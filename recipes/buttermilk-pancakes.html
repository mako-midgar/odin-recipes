    <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>3 large eggs</li>
      <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
      <li> Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
      <li>Make the pancakes: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.
