    <p>If these lemon ricotta pancakes were any lighter, they would float off the plate! They are easy to make and delicious served with a pat of butter, lemon zest, and a drizzle of maple syrup.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ¼ cups whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 cup milk, plus more if necessary</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon artificial sweetener</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ cup blueberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Sift flour and baking powder together into a bowl, set aside. Beat milk, egg, artificial sweetener, and salt together in a bowl; stir in flour mixture until just moistened. Add blueberries; stir to combine.</li>
      <li>Heat a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat; coat with cooking spray. Drop batter by ¼ cupfuls onto skillet and cook until bubbles form, about 1 ½ minutes. Flip and continue cooking until golden brown. Repeat with remaining batter. </li>
    </ol>
